# virtualspotlight
Simulates virtual spotlights. Ideal when projecting OBS outputs onto a stage

In OBS I use this browser page as a browser source and use the "Interact" feature to move the light towards the mouse pointer.
In a theatre you can use a stage projector to project the virtual spot lights.

- Mouse left down causes the light to move towards the mouse cursor.
- Mouse scroll wheel adjusts the size of the light
- CTRL + mouse scrollwheel adjusts the focus of the light
- SHIFT + mouse scrollwheel adjusts the GOBO used.

Currently there are only 3 gobos but it is easy enough to add more.

Todo:

- Add ALT + mouse scrollwheel to adjust intensity
- Add multi touch for multiple spotlights
- Add animation such as rotation and movement
